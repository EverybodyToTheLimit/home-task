# home-task

This is a laptop size landing page and you will need to animate some of the elements.


It starts with a door - on click, each door needs to slide left and right.


once the doors opens, it should reveal the beach scene (static elements, no need to animate except ONE of your choosing) and a CTA button


Animate this CTA button as you wish - once pressed it needs to show a video - video should not load at all until it is in view


if you have issues with fonts, you are allowed to replace them with google fonts


Optional: make the page responsive for mobile
